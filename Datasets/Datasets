### Datasets
We're going to be using the Indiana University X-Ray dataset, as it has full reports, from which we can extract full feature lists from the images, as well as being a reasonable sized dataset

That dataset has already been normalized, and converted from DICOM to PNG, so I've just written a quick script to alter the images to 256 x 256 so they can be consistently entered into a neural network


There are several other options for datasets - 

CheXpert:

NIH Chest X-Ray dataset:

VinBigData Chest X-Ray Abnormality Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection

For this specific problem, and as a simple example, these are a little too large (the first two are >100,000 images each), and the VinBigData X-ray dataset only has 1 of 14 potential features highlighted for each image, which is great for the problem they're working on specifically (using CV to put bounding boxes around those 1/14 things), but not great to write full radiology reports for each image.
